# Datasets

This project contains multiple datasets, upon completion there will be a 2D and 3D variant and another for pose estimation. 

Details will be published as they are available as well as information on how to apply each dataset. 

## 2D Instance Segementation Dataset 
The 2D dataset is being managed via Roboflow and can be found ([here](https://universe.roboflow.com/shiitake-harvest/shiitake-harvest))

The dataset contains 5,802 instances from 92 images. 

## RG-Depth Instance Segmentation dataset

The RG-Depth dataset, also on roboflow, can be found ([here](https://universe.roboflow.com/shiitake-harvest/rg-depth-shiitake-mushroom-dataset)

## Keypoint cut point detection dataset

The cut point dataset is currently stored on Google drive and the annotated dataset for both YOLOv8-pose and Detectron2 can downloaded through this ([link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F9fNhPb0nJCfJFHgSfpkQhekM__Jt6oe?usp=drive_link))
